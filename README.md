# odin-recipes

Basic recipe website for The Odin Project.

Upon completion the website will demonstrate an understanding of how to link pages, the use of tags to create paragraphs and lists; ordered and unordered, and the integration of images.

CSS and JavaScript are not part of this project, at least not initially.
